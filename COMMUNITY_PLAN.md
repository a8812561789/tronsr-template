Describe the plan to support the community
Actively support the community and developers of Tron's idle channels. Do your best to create a healthy environment for growth. If elected as part of Tron SR, we will reinvest part of it later into the creation of a technical team that can disseminate knowledge through tutorials and videos, with the common goal of achieving growth.

From the community to collect ideas on how to improve the system, our team will be ready to provide you with the best support needed to achieve this goal.

The bonus plan is also on the CryptoChain agenda. Stay tuned for further updates.
